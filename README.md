This is a project built for Hackoff 3.0. The problem statement we
 chose for the SIEMENS Healthineers Chatbot challenge. In this challenge
 we had to build a chatbot which addresses the problems of the user. For this chatbot 
 we have chosen the topic to be Cancer. Our Chatbot, addresses common doubts and concerns
 which a a patient may face.
 
For the chatbot we have used Rasa NLU. The chatbot is based on the intent and entity of the response
from the user. For the text corpus we have taken data from webmd.com.
