---Ovarian Cancer
-----------What is Ovarian Cancer?
When you have ovarian cancer, malignant cells begin to grow in the ovary. Cancer that starts in another part of your body can also spread, or metastasize, to your ovaries, but that is not considered ovarian cancer.
-----------Causes of Ovarian Cancer?
Researchers have many theories, but no one knows exactly what causes ovarian cancer. Scientists have not been able to find a single chemical in our environment or our diets that they can link specifically to ovarian cancer, unlike some other kinds of cancer. Certain things -- genetics or the way you live -- can increase the odds that you’ll get ovarian cancer, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you will get it.
------------How to prevent Ovarian Cancer?
Because so little is known about the specific causes of ovarian cancer, there’s not a long list of ways to prevent it.
If your family history points to an increased risk, your doctor can help you decide how best to manage your situation. Possible strategies include genetic testing and counseling. If your risk is high, you may decide to have your ovaries removed as a precaution. This surgery is called a prophylactic oophorectomy.
Eating a diet low in fat may lower your risk of ovarian cancer, and in general, exercising and maintaining a healthy weight can reduce your risk of many diseases.
---Stomach Cancer
------------What is Stomach Cancer?
Stomach cancer begins when cancer cells form in the inner lining of your stomach. These cells can grow into a tumor. Also called gastric cancer, the disease usually grows slowly over many years.
------------Causes of Stomach Cancer?
Smoking
Being overweight or obese
A diet high in smoked, pickled, or salty foods
Stomach surgery for an ulcer
Type-A blood
Epstein-Barr virus infection
Certain genes
Working in coal, metal, timber, or rubber industries
Exposure to asbestos

-------------Symptoms of Stomach Cancer?
Indigestion
Feeling bloated after you eat a meal
Heartburn
Slight nausea
Loss of appetite
Just having indigestion or heartburn after a meal doesn’t mean you have cancer. But if you feel these symptoms a lot, talk to your doctor. They can see if you have other risk factors and test you to look for any problems.
-------------How to Prevent Stomach Cancer?
Treat Stomach Infections
Eat Healthy
Don’t Smoke
Watch Aspirin or NSAID use(only if you use, consult a doctor)
